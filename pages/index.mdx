# Dušan Neckař

Hey, I'm a Software Developer at Seyfor.

I enjoy creating solutions that have a meaningful application.

I do things:

Design of key components, development of proof of concept, implementation of the approved solution using C#, .NET and React, deployment of the final product at the customer, and provision of ongoing maintenance and support.

This portfolio is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/).
